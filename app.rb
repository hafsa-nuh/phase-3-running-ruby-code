# puts "Hello world!"
# puts "Hello world!"
# puts "Hello world!"

# parentheses is optional in ruby
# puts("Hello world!")

# to run ruby we do it on the terminal and { ruby filename.rb}

# Ruby several methods for printing output to the terminal: puts, print
# print "Hello world!"
# print "Hello world!"
# print "Hello world!"

# the only difference is that puts will add a line break at the end of the string. 

# {puts == Hello world!
# Hello world!
# Hello world! }

# {print == Hello world!Hello world!Hello world! }

# puts [1, 2, 3]

#  p is a method for data inspection {calling the .inspect method on our data.}
# p [1, 2, 3]

# method, pp, for "pretty-printing" complex data == nested arrays and hashes 
# pp {by calling the .pretty_inspect method on our data.}
# pp [{ id: 1, hello: "World" }, { id: 2, hello: "Ruby" }, { id: 3, hello: "Moon" }, { id: 4, hello: "Learner" }]

# Ruby comes with a tool called IRB (Interactive Ruby) for running a Ruby REPL (read-evaluate-print-loop) in the terminal == for debugging // its just like console.log of js ==>{irb}

#  => nil { ==> this line is the return value of the puts method}

# in ruby => symbol returns a value , nil ==> is a no value and all methods have a return value

#  *****===> the puts method always returns nil <===******  #

#  RSpec Tests  =>RSpec is a Ruby gem (the Ruby equivalent of a npm package) that provides a domain-specific language


#  learn-lab test is what works for me

# puts "Hello world!"
puts "Hello World!"

# print "Hello world!"

print "Pass this test, please."
